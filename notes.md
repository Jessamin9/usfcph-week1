GIT verbs: Common actions developers do often. 
Fork + Clone: Fork: There's a copy out there, and I want to make my own copy of it. Clone: I want a copy specifically on my computer.
Commit: Lumping together changes. It's like a checkpoint. 
Push + Pull: Sending data to and from the copy that you have of the file and the internet. 
Branch: Taking my own copy, and making a sub-branch of it in a seperate place. When you're ready, you can connect the branch again. Good idea for making a change in your app and making sure it works in a seperate place instead of potentially messing up the original copy. 
Pull Request + Merge Request: One branch with a good idea, and they'd like permission to make it a part of the original copy.
