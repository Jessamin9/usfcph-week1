GIT verbs: Common actions developers do often. 
Fork + Clone: Fork: There's a copy out there, and I want to make my own copy of it. Clone: I want a copy specifically on my computer.
Commit: Lumping together changes. It's like a checkpoint. 
Push + Pull: Sending data to and from the copy that you have of the file and the internet. 
Branch: Taking my own copy, and making a sub-branch of it in a seperate place. When you're ready, you can connect the branch again. Good idea for making a change in your app and making sure it works in a seperate place instead of potentially messing up the original copy. 
Pull Request + Merge Request: One branch with a good idea, and they'd like permission to make it a part of the original copy. 
Front End (visual/interactive) and Back End (everything behind the scenes, the part of the app/software that you don't see) developers. A "full-stack" engineer can do both. 
Front End examples: XPlatform, iOS, Android, TV, Wearables(like an Apple watch), IOT, Web, Desktop, Specialty. 
UI: The "interior designers"; they decide the colors and designs. 
UX: What is the journey that the user is going on and what obstacles could they face. 
Divisions of the back end development: Security, data, logic, databases, AI(Artificial Intelligence)/ML(Machine Learning), and APIs (application programming interface). 
Developers work in teams: 
QA (Quality Assurance) People: Automated + Manual (making sure things work; ex. checking the quality of self-driving Teslas). 
Business Intelligence: BA + Product Owner + Project Manager + Subject Matter Expert. 
Operations: Developer Experience person + Data Base Admin + Site Reliability Engineer + Continuously Integrate/Continuously Deliver.
